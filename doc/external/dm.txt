1  ABOUT DM
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   A chimeric and strange language, the bastard offspring of C 
   and Python (!). Used only for BYOND. Compiled to bytecode.
   
   It's really poorly documented, so this should help.
   -------------------------------------------------------------

2  COMPILER
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   "The compiler was adapted from a program Dan had written for 
   a comp sci class (it was actually a program that obfuscated 
   code, lol, but it had the necessary parsing)" -- Tom
   
   Needless to say the compiler has not been maintained, and it
   remains a feral and dangerous beast that Lummox and Tom will 
   not touch with a ten-foot pole. Good luck with it.
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   
3  TYPING
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   DM is weakly (but statically) typed. The compiler actually
   runs casting checks at compile-time, then does absolutely
   nothing with that information other than nag the programmer
   if they don't typecast in a way that it appreciates.
   
   It's also stringly typed, ie tons of data is (and must be)
   encoded and passed in strings, even when it'd be more logical
   to use another format. For example, DM supports hexadecimal
   but passes colors as a hex value in a string. Also, lists
   are often encoded in the following format in BYOND procs:
   MIME type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ("params")
   -------------------------------------------------------------

4  LISTS
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   DM supports associative lists, including nesting. However, 
   only strings and paths are supported, and all other types can
   only be assigned to the terminal position (they can't be used
   as indices to retrieve associated data).
   
   BYOND has multiple internal list types (some of which are 
   read-only) but doesn't allow the user to define any more.
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   
5  NUMBERS
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   DM offers decimal, hex, and octal. Binary not included.
   Most numbers are single-precision floats. Binary arithmetic
   is 16-bit, and as such not supported past 1111 1111 1111 1111
   (or 65535 in decimal). Hex prefix is 0x, octal prefix is 0.
